Analog: (4)
2 for intake
1 for tote-lift
1 for bin Lift


drivetrain:
2 motors (one left one right)
powered by talons (old talons or victors)
encoder on each side (baumer with gearing)

Intake mechanism:
motor on each for spin (two)
motor on each for tilting (two)
pot on each for arm angle (two)
clutch allows for motor slippage while maintaining pot data
(different speeds for wheel rotation, using current draw)
(soft limit for arm angle due to wheels toching each other)

Tote-lift:
one motor & one Pot
(same as bin-lift)

Bin-lift:
one motor & one Pot
(PID gravity affected very mucho, multiple positions)

Claw:
one motor & two limit switches (travel endpoints)
(either in or out, needs a timer to stop)

coopertition-ramps:
two servos (PWM) (can be y-conector'd)
(either up or down)

Magazine-drop:
one motor & 2 limit switches
(two position)
